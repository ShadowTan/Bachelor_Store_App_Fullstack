# Bachelor Task: Enhancing In-Store Customer Experience with a Digital Solution

This repository contains the project developed for a Bachelor task focused on improving customer experience in retail stores. The primary objective was to create and implement a digital solution that enhances the shopping experience. We achieved this by designing and developing an interactive store map, which helps customers navigate the store efficiently, find products quickly, and enjoy a more streamlined shopping journey.

3. Sign in using your CLI
4. Open the BackEnd folder, and paste the code in sql_info.sql, then use the database and paste the test_data.sql
5. Open both folders (Frontend, Backend) separately and run "npm i"
6. then "npm run dev" on both
7. go to [localhost:5173](localhost:5173) and the store app should work
